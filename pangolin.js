Interestingly, where this species occurs in Sri Lanka it inhabits tropical rainforest, where it is believed to lead a more arboreal lifestyle - using its claws and prehensile tail to aid climbing. This species is native to India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",

As its name suggests, this is the largest of the pangolin species, weighing up to 35 kg. They inhabit the dense forests of West and Central Africa, and are always found near water sources.  They have large claws on their front legs, which they use to tear into termite mounds and dig burrows. When walking, they curl these claws backwards and inwards, so the weight falls onto the outside of the wrist.",
